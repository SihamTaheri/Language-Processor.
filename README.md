Java Language Processor README

Welcome to the Java Language Processor project! This tool aims to provide comprehensive lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis for standard Java code. Here's a guide on how the processor works and how to use it effectively.

Functionality Overview:
Input:

Source File: The processor receives a text file containing the Java program to be analyzed.
Output:

Token File: A list of all tokens generated for the analyzed input.
Symbol Table File: Complete dump of all symbol tables, including local scopes.
Parse File: List of rule numbers used for syntactic analysis.
Error Listing: If the source program contains errors, a list detailing the errors detected by the processor.
Usage:
Clone Repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Dependencies: Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed.
Run Processor: Execute the processor, providing the source file as input.
Review Output: Check the generated files for token lists, symbol tables, parse lists, and error listings.

Project Specifications:
The project involves the design and construction of an analyzer for a version of the JavaScript language named JS-PdL for Language Processors.
The implementation can utilize any programming language or tool as long as the result can be executed on a PC, preferably Windows.
